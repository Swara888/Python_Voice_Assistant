📝 Project Overview

This project is a Basic Voice Assistant developed using Python as part of the AICTE OIB-SIP Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

The assistant listens to user voice commands and performs predefined tasks such as responding to greetings, telling the time and date, searching the web, and opening websites.

The project demonstrates the practical implementation of:

🎤 Speech Recognition

🔊 Text-to-Speech Conversion

⚙️ Command Processing

🌐 Task Automation

🚀 Features

Responds to greetings (Hello / Hi)

Tells current time

Tells today’s date

Performs Google search

Opens YouTube

Exit/Stop command

Handles basic errors gracefully

Adjusts for ambient noise

🎯 Objectives

To understand how voice recognition works

To implement text-to-speech responses

To build an interactive voice-controlled system

To process user commands dynamically

To implement basic exception handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

speech_recognition

pyttsx3

datetime

webbrowser

sys

time

⚙️ Key Concepts Implemented
🔹 Speech Recognition

The assistant uses Google Speech Recognition API to convert spoken words into text.

🔹 Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The pyttsx3 library is used to convert text responses into speech output.

🔹 Command Handling

Conditional logic is used to match user commands and trigger corresponding actions.

🔹 Error Handling

The program handles:

Unrecognized voice input

Internet connectivity issues

Empty commands

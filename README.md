🎙️ Project Title: Voice Assistant
📌 Internship: AICTE OIB-SIP – Python Programming Internship

Organization: Oasis Infobyte
Intern: Swarali Vishnu Suryawanshi

📝 Project Description

This project is a Basic Voice Assistant developed using Python as part of the AICTE OIB-SIP Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

The assistant listens to user voice commands and performs simple tasks such as:

Responding to greetings

Telling the current time

Telling today’s date

Searching the web

Opening YouTube

Exiting on command

This project demonstrates the implementation of speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, command handling, and task automation using Python.

🎯 Objectives

To understand how voice recognition works

To implement text-to-speech responses

To build a simple interactive assistant

To handle user commands efficiently

To implement basic error handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

speech_recognition

pyttsx3

datetime

webbrowser

sys

time

⚙️ Key Concepts Implemented
🔹 Speech Recognition

The assistant uses Google Speech Recognition API to convert voice input into text.

🔹 Text-to-Speech

The pyttsx3 library is used to convert text responses into speech output.

🔹 Command Processing

User commands are processed using conditional statements to perform specific tasks.

🔹 Error Handling

The program handles:

Unknown voice input

Internet connectivity issues

Empty commands
